For docstrings, make sure all Python code follows PEP 8 and PEP 257 standards. Automatically generate docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes using Google's docstring style. Additionally, it is mandatory to include a module-level docstring at the beginning of each file. If an existing document string doesn't conform to Google's style, rewrite it to match the correct format. Docstrings for modules can never start with "This" and the docstring summary must always end with a period.
The last session requires a blank line after it.
